## How to setup
1. Install python 3.7.3.
    + This version is required because Raspbian has that version in their repository. If you are on Linux and on a different version try with ``pyenv``.
2. If you already have the python3 ``virtualenv`` binary, run ``virtualenv -p python nameofyourvenv``. This assumes that you are running this command while on python 3.7.3.
3. From within the virtual environment install the requirements.
```bash
# in koa-bot...
source venv/bin/activate
python -V # making sure it prints version 3.7.3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. It's done. Now run the bot from within the venv.

## How to run
The bot should automatically start on boot. You can manually run it by using the ``run.sh`` script on Linux, and ``winrun.bat`` on Windows.
